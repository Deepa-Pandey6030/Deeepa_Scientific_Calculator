# Scientific Calculator using Java Swing

Welcome to the repository for my **Scientific Calculator** project! This application is built using **Java Swing** and provides an intuitive interface for performing complex mathematical calculations.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This **Scientific Calculator** allows users to:
- Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Execute advanced functions such as trigonometry, logarithms, and exponential calculations.
- Handle complex expressions with ease using the **exp4j library**.
- View a history of calculations performed during the session.
